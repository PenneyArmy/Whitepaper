# Whitepaper for the Penney Army Initiative (draft)

## 1. Introduction
Penney Army is a groundbreaking meme community experiment that aims to leverage the power of NFTs and innovative community tokenomics to support its launch, development and long-term sustainability. This whitepaper outlines the key features, objectives, and strategies of Penney Army, showcasing its potential to disrupt the meme space.

## 2. Problem Statement
The meme space lacks a sustainable funding model and fails to provide meaningful incentives for community participation. Traditional funding methods often fall short in supporting meme projects and fail to reward early contributors adequately. There's also the a valid lack of trust in founders and developers due to widespread and enabled corruption, ultimately leading to failure of projects and tainting the community's perspective on any future potential in the space in general. Penney Army aims to address these challenges by being transparent, maintaining open communications with the community, introducing NFTs and a community token to revolutionize the way memes are created, funded, and sustained.

## 3. Solution Overview
Penney Army will maintain regular and open communications with the community, answering questions in a timely manner. We will utilize NFTs as a fundraising mechanism, offering unique and limited-edition digital collectibles to raise funds for the project's launch, development, and growth. The sale of these NFTs will provide initial funding while offering supporters a chance to own exclusive meme artifacts. Additionally, NFT holders will become eligible for community token distribution. Security and transparency audits of all relevant mechanisms will be conducted, outlined, and communicated in a clear and consise manner.

## 4. NFT Fundraising
Penney Army's NFT sales will allow meme enthusiasts and supporters to contribute to the project's funding while acquiring valuable digital assets. These NFTs will represent ownership of rare and sought-after meme creations, contributing to the uniqueness and scarcity of the Pepe and Penney ecosystems.

## 5. Community Token
To foster a vibrant and engaged community, Penney Army will introduce a native community token ▇▇▇▇ ($▇▇▇▇). This token will be distributed to NFT holders, incentivizing participation and rewarding early supporters. The community token will have unique tokenomics designed to sustain the project and provide additional benefits to token holders, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement.

## 6. Tokenomics
The community token's tokenomics will be carefully crafted to ensure the longevity and growth of Penney. Potential features may include deflationary mechanisms, staking rewards, and governance capabilities, empowering token holders to shape the project's future. These tokenomics will align the interests of the community with the success and sustainability of Penney. Once finalized, the official tokenomics will be added here including any links to deployed contracts for public review and audit.

## 7. Live Roadmap
Penney Army has outlined a comprehensive live roadmap that encompasses key milestones, including the NFT fundraiser effort, community token distribution, development updates, and strategic partnerships. The roadmap will provide a clear timeline for the project's growth and development, enhancing transparency and accountability.

## 8. Conclusion
Penney Army represents an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the meme space by integrating NFTs and innovative community tokenomics. By leveraging these technologies, Penney Army aims to create a sustainable funding model while fostering an active and passionate community. Together, we can redefine the future of memes and establish a pioneering bastion in the space.
